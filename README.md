================

Our game. Scoped-down, but still hopefully fun. Let's see where we go, okay?

Instructions:
Click an empty tile to place an arrow.
Hit enter to start movement.
You can hit space before you start moving to accelerate, but you can only turn it back on before a level starts.
You can only adjust your most recent tile without having an effect on the maximum number of tiles you can place per level.
White and red arrow tiles rotate clockwise automatically after you hit them, gray and red ones rotate counterclockwise.
